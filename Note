Hi. This is sort of a foreign area for some of you but this "base project" logic is intended
for us to learn more about programming, team style. Where you could actually work on
different parts of the project but still be evident on the other changes
your other teammates have done. If you have questions, ask me. This is also for
a more organized coding system in which this knowledge will prove useful to you once you
take on the outside working class world. Thank you! :)
